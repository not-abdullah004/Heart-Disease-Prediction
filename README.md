# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict whether a person is at risk of **heart disease** using medical data.  
It demonstrates **binary classification**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **model evaluation** using standard metrics.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict the presence of heart disease (Yes / No)
- Identify the most important health features affecting heart disease risk

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Heart Disease UCI Dataset**
- Source: Kaggle
- File: `heart.csv`


## 🧪 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Checked for missing values (none found)
- Generated statistical summaries
- Analyzed feature correlations

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Heart disease distribution
- Age vs heart disease comparison
- Correlation heatmap of all features

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
### Logistic Regression (Main Model)
- Used for binary classification
- Provides interpretable feature importance

### Decision Tree (Optional)
- Used for comparison
- Limited depth to reduce overfitting

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using:
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC Curve**
- **ROC-AUC Score**
- **Classification Report**

---

## 🔍 Important Features
The most influential features include:
- Chest pain type (`cp`)
- Maximum heart rate (`thalach`)
- ST depression (`oldpeak`)
- Number of major vessels (`ca`)
- Exercise-induced angina (`exang`)
